## Requirements ðŸ’»

**1. Python**

This tool requires Python 3 interpreter to be installed on user's system and added to the `PATH` system variable so that python files can be easily executed from the terminal.

**2. Packages**

This project only uses 1 external library that you need to install a package from PyPi called `yattag`
```
pip install yattag
```

Alternatively, all the dependencies used by project that need to be installed are configured in the `requirements.txt` file included in the project.

The following command installs all the dependencies configured in the requirements.txt file with corresponding versions.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features
Converts **text** or **markdown** files to **html** files that can be rendered as web pages.

### Common features
* Parses the first line as **web page title** and top level heading if followed by 2 empty newlines.
* Parses all **text blocks**, delimeted by an empty line, as **`p` tags** for the html.
* Parses **headings** just like github markdown. For example, a line starting with `# ` translates to an `h1`,  `## ` to and `h2`, and so on...

### Exclusive to markdown
* Any piece of text wrapped with `**` is converted to `strong` tag (bolded) in html, and wrapped with `*` is converted to `em` tag (italicized).
