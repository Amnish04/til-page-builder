TIL Argparse


While developing this commandline tool for release 0.1, I learned about a very useful in-built library in python called argparse that makes working with commandline arguments extremely easy.

## How to use

Its very simple to configure and start using this library.

All you need to do is create an ArgumentParser object, and define the arguments and their behavior with various annotations.
