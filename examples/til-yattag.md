# TIL *Yattag*


Today I learned how to use **Yattag**, a python library used to generate html markup in an extremely *Pythonic* way making the entire process seem like a piece of cake.

## How to install

As with any other library, just install the package from ***Pypi*** - the package distribution library for python.

pip install yattag

And voila, you're ready to use it.

## How to use

Here's a simple code *snippet* that makes use of this library:



with tag('p'):

    text("some random text")
